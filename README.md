# Chuk MCP Open-Meteo

**The best weather MCP server ever** - A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for accessing Open-Meteo weather data.

> This is a demonstration project provided as-is for learning and testing purposes.

## Features

This MCP server provides comprehensive access to Open-Meteo's weather APIs through six powerful tools.

**All tools return fully-typed Pydantic v2 models** for type safety, validation, and excellent IDE support. Every model includes rich, LLM-friendly field descriptions with interpretation guides for better AI understanding.

### 1. Weather Forecast (`get_weather_forecast`)
Get detailed weather forecasts with customizable parameters:
- Current weather conditions
- Hourly forecasts (up to 16 days)
- Daily forecasts
- 50+ weather variables including temperature, precipitation, wind, humidity, cloud cover, and more
- Multiple units (celsius/fahrenheit, km/h, mph, m/s, knots)
- Automatic timezone detection

### 2. Location Geocoding (`geocode_location`)
Convert location names to coordinates:
- Search for any location worldwide
- Get coordinates, elevation, timezone
- Country and administrative information
- Population data where available
- Multi-language support

### 3. Historical Weather (`get_historical_weather`)
Access historical weather data:
- Data from 1940 onwards (location-dependent)
- Same comprehensive variables as forecasts
- Perfect for climate analysis and trends
- Hourly and daily aggregations

### 4. Air Quality (`get_air_quality`)
Monitor air quality and pollutants:
- PM2.5, PM10 particulate matter
- CO, NO2, SO2, O3 gas concentrations
- European AQI and US AQI indices
- Pollen data (multiple species)
- UV index
- Aerosol optical depth

### 5. Marine Forecast (`get_marine_forecast`)
Get marine weather conditions:
- Wave height, direction, and period
- Wind waves and swell waves separately
- Ocean current velocity and direction
- Up to 16-day forecasts
- Essential for maritime activities
- Field descriptions include wave quality interpretations (0-0.5m calm, 1.5-2.5m moderate, etc.)

### 6. Weather Code Interpretation (`interpret_weather_code`)
Translate numeric weather codes to descriptions:
- Converts WMO weather codes (0-99) to human-readable text
- Includes severity categories (clear, rain, snow, thunderstorm, etc.)
- Helps LLMs explain weather conditions in natural language
- Built-in reference for all standard weather codes

## Installation

### Using uvx (Recommended - No Installation Required!)

The easiest way to use the server is with `uvx`, which runs it without installing:

```bash
uvx chuk-mcp-open-meteo
```

This automatically downloads and runs the latest version. Perfect for Claude Desktop!

### Using uv (Recommended for Development)

```bash
# Install from PyPI
uv pip install chuk-mcp-open-meteo

# Or clone and install from source
git clone <repository-url>
cd chuk-mcp-open-meteo
uv sync --dev
```

### Using pip (Traditional)

```bash
pip install chuk-mcp-open-meteo
```

## Usage

### With Claude Desktop

#### Option 1: Use the Public Server (Easiest)

Connect to the hosted public server at `weather.chukai.io`:

**MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weather": {
      "url": "https://weather.chukai.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Run Locally with uvx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-meteo": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["chuk-mcp-open-meteo"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Run Locally with pip

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-meteo": {
      "command": "chuk-mcp-open-meteo"
    }
  }
}
```

### Standalone

Run the server directly:

```bash
# With uvx (recommended - always latest version)
uvx chuk-mcp-open-meteo

# With uvx in HTTP mode
uvx chuk-mcp-open-meteo http

# Or if installed locally
chuk-mcp-open-meteo
chuk-mcp-open-meteo http
```

Or with uv/Python:

```bash
# STDIO mode (default, for MCP clients)
uv run chuk-mcp-open-meteo
# or: python -m chuk_mcp_open_meteo.server

# HTTP mode (for web access)
uv run chuk-mcp-open-meteo http
# or: python -m chuk_mcp_open_meteo.server http
```

**STDIO mode** is for MCP clients like Claude Desktop and mcp-cli.
**HTTP mode** runs a web server on http://localhost:8000 for HTTP-based MCP clients.

## Example Usage

Once configured, you can ask Claude questions like:

- "What's the current weather in London?"
- "Give me a 7-day forecast for Tokyo with hourly temperature and precipitation"
- "What was the weather like in New York on July 4th, 2020?"
- "What's the air quality in Los Angeles right now?"
- "What are the wave conditions off the coast of Hawaii?"
- "Find the coordinates for Paris, France"

### Python Examples

Check out the `examples/` directory for runnable Python examples:

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv run python examples/example_basic.py
uv run python examples/example_trip_planner.py
uv run python examples/test_mcp_protocol.py

# Or with plain python (if installed)
python examples/example_basic.py
python examples/example_trip_planner.py
python examples/test_mcp_protocol.py

# Run all examples
./examples/test_all.sh
```

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## Tool Reference

All tools return **Pydantic v2 models** with full type safety. When calling from Python, you get clean object access:

# Get weather forecast
forecast = await get_weather_forecast(latitude=51.5072, longitude=-0.1276, current_weather=True)

# Access data via typed attributes (not dictionaries!)
if forecast.current_weather:
    temp = forecast.current_weather.temperature  # Type-safe access
    wind = forecast.current_weather.windspeed
```
