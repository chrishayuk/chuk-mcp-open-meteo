## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **New Tool**: `interpret_weather_code` - Translate WMO weather codes into human-readable descriptions
  - Returns Pydantic `WeatherCodeInterpretation` model
  - Comprehensive documentation of all weather codes (0-99)
  - Includes severity categories for better LLM understanding
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Massively improved docstrings for all tools
  - Added "Tips for LLMs" sections with guidance on tool usage
  - Detailed parameter descriptions with examples
  - Common use cases and best practices
  - Weather code reference in forecast tool
  - Wave height and period interpretation guides for marine forecast
  - Activity recommendations based on conditions
- **Enhanced Pydantic Models**: All field descriptions now include LLM-friendly context
  - `HourlyMarine`: Wave height ranges (0-0.5m=calm, 0.5-1.5m=small, etc.)
  - `HourlyMarine`: Wave period quality indicators (<8s=choppy, 8-12s=good, 12s+=excellent)
  - `CurrentWeather`: Wind direction explanations (0=from North, 90=from East, etc.)
  - `CurrentWeather`: Weather code quick reference in field description
  - `HourlyWeather`: Clarified precipitation types and units
  - `DailyWeather`: Added descriptions for daily aggregates
  - All direction fields now explain meteorological convention
  - All models include docstrings with usage guidance

### Changed
- Updated Pydantic models to use ConfigDict instead of deprecated class-based Config
- Improved test coverage to 99% (all files >90%)
- Added comprehensive tests for all API parameters and edge cases
- Enhanced all tool docstrings with LLM-friendly guidance
- Added comprehensive weather code database (WMO codes 0-99)

### Fixed
- Removed `uv.lock` from `.gitignore` to fix CI/CD cache dependency resolution

## [1.1.0] - 2024-11-22

### Added
- **Pydantic Models**: All API responses now use Pydantic v2 models for type safety
  - `WeatherForecast`, `CurrentWeather`, `HourlyWeather`, `DailyWeather`
  - `GeocodingResponse`, `GeocodingResult`
  - `HistoricalWeather`
  - `AirQualityResponse`, `HourlyAirQuality`
  - `MarineForecast`, `HourlyMarine`, `DailyMarine`
- Full type hints throughout the codebase
- `MANIFEST.in` for proper package distribution
- `mypy.ini` for type checking configuration
- Comprehensive Pydantic model documentation in models.py

### Changed
- **Breaking**: All tool functions now return Pydantic models instead of dictionaries
- Tools are now fully async-native (already were, but now enforced by Pydantic)
- Improved type safety and IDE autocomplete support
- Better validation of API responses

### Fixed
- Server now defaults to STDIO transport mode for proper MCP client compatibility
- Logging configured to use stderr and ERROR level in STDIO mode (no noise in JSON-RPC stream)
- Corrected API endpoints:
  - Geocoding: Now uses `geocoding-api.open-meteo.com` (was incorrect)
  - Historical: Now uses `archive-api.open-meteo.com` (was incorrect)
- Python version requirement updated to >=3.11 (matches chuk-mcp-server dependency)
- Bare except clauses replaced with specific exception handling
- Code formatted with ruff
